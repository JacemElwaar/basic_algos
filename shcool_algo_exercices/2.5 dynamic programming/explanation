The document explains Dynamic Programming (DP) as a technique for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It highlights key elements, presents algorithms, and provides exercises to illustrate applications.

### Overview of Dynamic Programming
1. Key Features:
   - Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution can be built using optimal solutions to sub-problems.
   - Overlapping Sub-Problems: Problems can be recursively divided into smaller sub-problems.

2. Principle of Optimality:
   - Optimal decisions at each stage depend only on the state of the problem at that stage.

3. Implementation:
   - DP employs recursion combined with memoization to store and reuse solutions of sub-problems.

### Algorithms and Example Problems
#### 1. Shortest-Path Problem
   - Description: Find the shortest path in a graph between two points.
   - Approach: Use a recursive relationship to calculate the shortest path from node \(i\) to node \(j\).
   - Problem: Given a graph with costs between nodes, determine the shortest path between specific nodes.

#### 2. Knapsack Problem
   - Description: Allocate items to maximize value without exceeding weight constraints.
   - Approach: Solve recursively, storing results for each weight-capacity combination.
   - Problem: Fill a 10-lb knapsack with items of specific weights and values.

#### 3. Resource Allocation Problem
   - Description: Allocate resources among activities to maximize overall revenue.
   - Approach: Divide resources into stages, compute optimal allocation iteratively.
   - Problem: Allocate 6 giga FLOPS among three activities to maximize revenue.

#### 4. Cell Assignment Problem
   - Description: Assign users to base stations to maximize connection quality while minimizing interference.
   - Approach: Model as a multi-knapsack problem where each base station represents a knapsack.
   - Problem: Assign end-users based on signal-to-interference ratio.

#### 5. VM Placement Problem
   - Description: Optimize placement of virtual machines (VMs) in a data center.
   - Approach:
     - Algorithms like First Fit, First Fit Decreasing, and Best Fit are used.
     - Aim to minimize energy consumption or maximize placement efficiency.
   - Problem: Solve a 3D multi-knapsack problem to allocate VMs to resources like CPU, RAM, and storage.

#### 6. Service Function Chain (SFC) Allocation
   - Description: Map Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) onto servers while minimizing resource use.
   - Approach: Use DP or integer linear programming (ILP) to allocate VNFs optimally.
   - Problem: Map VNFs of three SFC types onto edge and core servers.
