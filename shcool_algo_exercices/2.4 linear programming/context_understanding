Problem Setup
Objective Function

Maximize the profit:

    Z = 40*x1 + 30*x2

where:
    x1 = Number of Product A produced. 
    x2 = Number of Product B produced.
    Profit per unit of Product A = $40.
    Profit per unit of Product B = $30. 

Constraints

Machine Hours:
Each unit of Product A requires 2 machine hours, and Product B requires 1 machine hour. 
The company has a maximum of 100 machine hours:

    2*x1 + x2 <= 100
 
Labor Hours:
Each unit of Product A requires 1 labor hour, and Product B requires 2 labor hours. 
The company has a maximum of 80 labor hours:

    x1 + 2*x2 <=80

Non-negativity:
The number of products cannot be negative:
    x1 < 0 , x2 < 0


steps in linear programming problems : 

Stp1) 
    maximize profitablity means maximize Z with: 
    Z = 40*x1 + 30*x2
    we have already these condition : 
        2*x1 + x2 <= 100
        x1 + 2*x2 <=80
        x1 < 0 , x2 < 0 ==> whitch is a little bit domp here 
    

stp2) 
    trying to solve it graphicaly :
    where i have a solution of the system 
        2*x1 + x2 = 100
        x1 + 2*x2 =80 
        => as i need to use all the ressources for a max gains 
        try the solutions of the system and find out when Z maximizes.  
    


Mathematics Behind Linear Programming
Linear Programming relies on these core mathematical concepts:

1) Convexity:
    The feasible region formed by linear constraints is a convex polytope.
    The optimal solution always lies at a vertex (corner point) of the feasible region.
        
    => the set or the area of solutions that happen to respect all the constraint and resolves the problem. 


2) Simplex Method:
    A mathematical algorithm that starts from one vertex of the feasible region and moves along edges 
    to adjacent vertices to improve the objective function until no further improvement is possible.
    It efficiently avoids checking every vertex, focusing only on those that improve the solution.

    find al the vertexes inside of the feasable ara and try them out until finaly we find the ideal solution.
    add constants that


3) Duality:
    Every linear programming problem (primal) has a dual problem. The solution to the dual gives insights into the primal, and vice versa.
    The dual variables often represent shadow prices, giving information on how much the objective would change if constraints were relaxed.

4) Matrix Representation:
    LP problems are expressed in matrix form for computational efficiency:
    Maximize 
    Z=c(T)x
    Maximize Z=c(T)x
    Subject to:
    Ax ≤ b, x ≥ 0
    Ax ≤ b, x ≥ 0
    Where:
        A: Coefficient matrix of constraints.
        x: Decision variable vector.
        b: Constraint bounds.
        c: Coefficients of the objective function.
